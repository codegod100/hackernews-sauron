- [x] Make the top stories link intercepted with mouse clicks
- [X] Make comment item become the page content.

    - Generate an `index.html` file based on `page` module with no app.
- [X] Refactor code for Http fetch_stories.
    - Make a utility to convert futures into `Cmd`.
- [ ] Make a static database file format, where the app still works on
    static hosting sites (ie: no database, such as github pages, netlify)
- [ ] when stories are keyed, the patches are not working properly
    - unable to find the child to be replaced
    - apparent when clicking from top, then to best, to show
